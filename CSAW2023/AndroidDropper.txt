Put in cyberchef with magic tool:
For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, csawctf{dyn4m1c_lo4deRs_r_fuN!}
the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.


Flag:
csawctf{dyn4m1c_lo4deRs_r_fuN!}
