Satellite Killer
Most satellites get to live out a relatively peaceful existence in space until their orbit eventually decays and they fall back to Earth.
Most.
Back in the 80's, one poor satellite met a premature end at the hands of an ASM-135.
I would like you to find the date that the second-to-last piece of its debris fell back down to Earth (Or more realistically, its decay date).
In addition, please give me its object ID/International Code.
*Flag format: PCTF{OBJECTID_YEAR-MONTH-DAY} *
For example, for a piece of debris from the Falcon 9, the flag would look like this: PCTF{2023-028BG_2023-3-15}

On September 13, 1985, the satellite was destroyed in orbit at 20:43 UTC at 35°N 126°W with an altitude of 525 kilometres (326 mi)[5] by an ASM-135 ASAT launched from a US Air Force F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft. The test resulted in 285 cataloged pieces of orbital debris. 1 piece of debris remained in orbit to at least May 2004,[10] but had deorbited by 2008.[5] The last piece of debris, COSPAR 1979-017GX, SATCAT 16564, deorbited 9 May 2004 according to SATCAT.

Looked for:
Solwind

Issue:
Only up to 100 search results show at a time. There are 285 debris.

Went to:
https://in-the-sky.org/search.php?s=&searchtype=Spacecraft&satorder=0&lyearmin=1979&lyearmax=1980

Searched:
solwind deb with a launch date between 1979 and 2009 (2009 part not needed since all belong to Solwind) (got solwind deb name from n2yo website step)

Looked for:
1979-017GX in 2004 (because it is the last debris according to previous wikipedia step)

Looked for:
Last Debris with flight ended date before 1979-017GX in 2004 (used Ctrl+f and typed “200” since  I saw there were a few 2000s dates)

Saw:
1979-017AN with flight ended 06 Dec 2002


Answer: PCTF{1979-017AN_2002-12-6}
