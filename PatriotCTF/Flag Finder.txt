Flag Finder

All you have to do is guess the flag.
Flag format: pctf{}

nc chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club 4757


discord hint says checks length, then takes letters and numbers, also includes flag format "pctf{}"

we found the length (kept adding 1 till something happened):
1111111111111111111
returns "theres been an error"


retype with format (replaced 1s):
pctf{aaaaaaaaaaaaa}

returns:
1:112
2:99
3:116
4:102
5:123

put into cyber chef:
-to charcode
-from hex
-to decimal

112= p
99= c
116= t
102= f
123= {

now we know it returns the correct characters

pctf{Taaaaaaaaaaaa}
84=T

looked up common letters after t (vowels showed up):
https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/110576/what-are-the-most-common-letters-used-in-pairs-after-others-in-the-english-alpha

looked up leet-speak as well:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet

General strategy:
if I wasn't sure
-checked what letter is most common after one found
--if it was a vowel, then checked a,e,i,o,u, in lower-case, upper-case, and leet-speak
-started with replacing "a" with numbers 0-9
-replaced "a" with letters b-z
-replaced "a" with letters B-Z

if I thought I was sure
-tried to look up the letters I found and match it to an existing phrase (didn't work for this one)

pctf{Tiaaaaaaaaaaa}
105=i

pctf{Timaaaaaaaaaa}

pctf{Tim3ingaaaaaa}
103=g

pctf{Tim3ingIaaaaa}
73=I

pctf{Tim3ingI8aaaa}
56=8

pctf{Tim3ingI8Naaa}
78=N

pctf{Tim3ingI8N3aa}
51=3
97=a

pctf{Tim3ingI8N3at}
116=t
125=}
